# RuATD
[Trello проекта](https://trello.com/invite/b/seH8Teau/ada24d62b1965863a77963227a96de55/ruatd)

We present our experiments on RuATD Shared Task Dataset that containts sentences generated by humans and different generative models.

Our pipeline was constructed in a following way:

We experimented with models for binary classification (baselines are marked as bold): 

| encoding      | classifier   | binary: accuracy |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| BoW+TF-IDF    | FNN          | 0.73             |
| word2vec      | LSTM         | 0.59             |
| character     | CNN          | 0.66             |
| RuBERT-tiny   | fine-tuning  | 0.81             |
| text features | FNN          | 0.6              |
| text features | Logreg       | 0.61             |
| text features | RandomForest | 0.64             |
| **BERT**          |              | **0.79622**          |
| **TF-DF**         | Logreg       | **0.63562**          |

We chose RuBERT-tiny as the best model.

Then we tried different models on classification of texts that RuBERT-tiny recognised as "non-human".

| encoding      | classifier   | accuracy    | macro f1-score |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| TF-IDF        | FNN          | 0.3         | 0.29           |
| word2vec      | LSTM         | 0.29        | 0.25           |
| character     | CNN          | 0.37        | 0.32           |
| text features | FNN          | 0.26        | 0.17           |
| text features | Logreg       | 0.22        | 0.1            |
| text features | RandomForest | 0.27        | 0.24           |
| Combo Model   |              | 0.39        | 0.35           |

We chose Combo model that includes parts of other models' acrhitectures in the following way:

![alt text](https://github.com/EkaterinaVoloshina/RuATD/raw/main/img/photo_2022-03-22_00-28-59.jpg)

Combined with RuBERT-tiny, the Combo model shows 0.5 accuracy.
