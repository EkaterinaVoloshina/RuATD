[Trello проекта](https://trello.com/invite/b/seH8Teau/ada24d62b1965863a77963227a96de55/ruatd)

We present our experiments on RuATD Shared Task Dataset that containts sentences generated by humans and different generative models.

Our pipeline was constructed in a following way:

We experimented with models for binary classification: 

| encoding      | classifier   | binary: accuracy |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| BoW+TF-IDF    | FNN          | 0.73             |
| word2vec      | LSTM         | 0.59             |
| character     | CNN          | 0.66             |
| Native LM     | fine-tuning  | 0.81             |
| text features | FNN          | 0.6              |
| text features | Logreg       | 0.61             |
| text features | RandomForest | 0.64             |
| **BERT**          |              | **0.79622**          |
| **TF-DF**         | Logreg       | **0.63562**          |
